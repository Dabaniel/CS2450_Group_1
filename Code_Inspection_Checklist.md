| **Code Inspection Checklist** |
|Applied to UVSim.py  
| ------------------------------------- |
| **1. Code Formatting and Style** |
| - Is the code consistently formatted? |
_Most of the functions follow consistent format_
| - Are naming conventions followed for variables, functions, etc.? |
_No, some camelCase variables and functions need renaming_
| **2. Correctness and Completeness** |
| - Are all algorithms implemented correctly? |
_Yes_
| - Are there any logical errors or incorrect assumptions? |
_No_
| **3. Efficiency** |
| - Are there any unnecessary computations or redundant operations? |
_No_
| - Can any parts of the code be optimized for better performance? |
_Only updating the immedeately affected variables in the GUI_
| **4. Error Handling** |
| - Are potential errors or exceptions handled properly? |
_Errors do get handled, but some are implemented differently than others_
| - Is there appropriate input validation to prevent unexpected issues? |
_Input is implemented for each instruction or comment_
| **5. Documentation and Comments** |
| - Is the code well-documented, explaining the purpose and logic of complex sections? |
_Most methods have docstrings and complex lines have comments_
| - Are all functions and modules accompanied by comments describing their behavior? |
_The modules each need a docstring_
| **6. Security** |
| - Are there any security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injections or buffer overflows? |
_No_
| - Is sensitive data properly encrypted and secured? |
_There is no known reason to use sensitive data with our program_
| **7. Portability and Maintainability** |
| - Is the code written in a way that it can be easily adapted or modified? |
_Yes, the code follow design patterns for maintainability and extensions_
| - Are there hard-coded values that could be replaced with variables or constants? |
_No_
