The project is split into UVSim, Window, and Stack.
UVSim holds all of the operations the user will need to have functioning BasicML. It will also have the accumulator/register.
This involves cohesion of the operations and files associated with UVSim. The operations relate to each other on a high level,
the other methods are required to start the BasicML program, and they are all held together by the UVSim class.

The GUI is held in a separate class that inherits from UVSim. This relation is the low coupling of the project.
Besides the inherited values for the GUI, there will be other methods for creating each aspect that the user
will interact with.

The last section of the project has the stack which is a composition with the Window class.
The stack functions as a data structure that can handle push, pop, and other key stack methods.
The reason for the composition with the GUI is to be able to display the stack from the GUI, which
uses the data and user input from UVSim. Each of these classes are working as a model view controller
design.
