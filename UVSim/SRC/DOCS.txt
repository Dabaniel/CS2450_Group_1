When writing an operations, there are two necessary parts:
  - The first three characters represent the "opcode," the code for the operation, and will be '+XX'. The 'XX' must be a code for an operation: i.e. '+11' is WRITE.
  - The following characters will be a memory address, i.e. '+XXxx', where xx is the memory address.

EX:
Write value in memory location '00' into console: '+1100'

Working commands:

READ    / '+10XX': Read the following console input into memory location 'XX'.
WRITE   / '+11XX': Write value at memory location 'XX' into console.
LOAD    / '+20XX': 
STORE   / '+21XX':
