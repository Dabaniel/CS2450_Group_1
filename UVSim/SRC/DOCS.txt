When writing an operations, there are two necessary parts:
  <ul>
    <li> The first three characters (if using a 4-Digit word) represent the "opcode," the code for the operation, and will be '+XX'. The 'XX' must be a code for an operation: i.e. '+11' is WRITE.</li>
    <li> The following characters will be a memory address, i.e. '+XXxx', where xx is the memory address.</li>
  </ul>

EX:
Write value in memory location '00' into console: '+1100'

<br>Working commands:</br>

<ul>
  <li> READ        / '+10XX': Read the following console input into memory location 'XX'.</li>
  <li> WRITE       / '+11XX': Write value at memory location 'XX' into console.</li>
  <li> LOAD        / '+20XX': Load a word from a specific location in memory into the accumulator.</li>
  <li> STORE       / '+21XX': Store a word from the accumulator into a specific location in memory.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>ADD**       / '+30XX": Add a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator </li></li>
  <li>SUB**       / '+31XX': Subtract a word from a specific location in memory from the word in the accumulator</li></li>
  <li>DIVIDE**    / '+32XX': Divide the word in the accumulator by a word from a specific location in memory</li></li>
  <li>MULTIPLY**  / '+33XX': Multiply a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator</li></li>
</ul>
**leaves the result in the accumulator

<ul>
  <li>BRANCH      / '+40XX': Branch to a specific location in memory</li>
  <li>BRANCHNEG   / '+41XX': Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is negative.</li>
  <li>BRANCHZERO  / '+42XX': Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is zero.</li>
  <li>HALT        / '+43XX': Pause the program</li>
</ul>
