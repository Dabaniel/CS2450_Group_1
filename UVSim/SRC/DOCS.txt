When writing an operations, there are two necessary parts:
  - The first three characters (if using a 4-Digit word) represent the "opcode," the code for the operation, and will be '+XX'. The 'XX' must be a code for an operation: i.e. '+11' is WRITE.
  - The following characters will be a memory address, i.e. '+XXxx', where xx is the memory address.

EX:
Write value in memory location '00' into console: '+1100'

Working commands:

READ        / '+10XX': Read the following console input into memory location 'XX'.
WRITE       / '+11XX': Write value at memory location 'XX' into console.
LOAD        / '+20XX': Load a word from a specific location in memory into the accumulator.
STORE       / '+21XX': Store a word from the accumulator into a specific location in memory.

ADD**       / '+30XX": Add a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator 
SUB**       / '+31XX': Subtract a word from a specific location in memory from the word in the accumulator
DIVIDE**    / '+32XX': Divide the word in the accumulator by a word from a specific location in memory
MULTIPLY**  / '+33XX': Multiply a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator
**leaves the result in the accumulator

BRANCH      / '+40XX': Branch to a specific location in memory
BRANCHNEG   / '+41XX': Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is negative.
BRANCHZERO  / '+42XX': Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is zero.
HALT        / '+43XX': Pause the program
