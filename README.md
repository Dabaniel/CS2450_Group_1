# CS2450_Group_1

This is the shared Project space for CS 2450-002 Group 1.

# Members:

Amy Mendoza,
Anthony Jankovic,
Dan Smith,
Enoch Gillman

# Project Language:

Python

As a unit the team felt it appopriate to develop this code using a language that we are
familiar with. This will allow us the flexibility to help one another should any of us get
stuck. It also allows the space to look for additional recources since the code is widely
popular and well known.

# Source Control:

GitHub was chosen as it is a free platform and the team all had a little experience using it.

# Meeting Times/ Schedule:

Friday Evenings; 5:30-6:00 PM,

Saturdays as needed

The majority of the team is available to have scrum meetings via Teams Video Call. We will  
 start meeting this way and if it becomes needed as the project progresses, we are able to  
 accommodate meeting at UVU Fulton Library, Daniel's house (As long as there are 6 chairs  
 present), or we can road trip to Enoch's parents home.

# Project Planner/ Management:

We are using Planner which is offered to facilty and students for free as part of the 365
subscription for UVU. The platform offers the ability to assign tasks and also see who is
marking/ making contributions.

# Scrum Rotations:

We will rotate alphabetically through teammembers for 2 week period durations. The last
couple weeks left over will either be on a volunteer basis or we will default to allowing
Chwazee to assign scrum master for us.

# Meeting Scribes/ Report:

Will rotate alphabetically starting with Anthony, Daniel, Enoch, Amy.
