<h1>UVSIM Application</h1>
The UVSIM application is a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to assist computer science students to learn machine language and computer architecture. 

The UVUSIM is a virtual machine and can only interpret a machine language called BasicML. 
The UVSim contains CPU, register, and main memory. An accumulator â€“ a register into which information is put before the UVSim uses it in calculations or examines it in various ways. All the information in the UVSim is handled in terms of words.

A word is a signed four-digit or a six-digit decimal number, such as +1234, -5678 or +001234, -005678. The BasicML program must be loaded into the main memory starting at location 00 before executing. Each instruction written in BasicML occupies one word of the UVSim memory (instruction are signed four-digit or six-digit decimal number). Each location in the UVSim memory may contain an instruction, a data value used by a program or an unused area of memory. The first two digits of each BasicML instruction are the operation code specifying the operation to be performed.
