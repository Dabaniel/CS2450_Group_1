# CS2450_Group_1

This is the shared Project space for CS 2450-002 Group 1.

# Members:

Amy Mendoza,
Anthony Jankovic,
Dan Smith,
Enoch Gillman

# Project Language:

Python

As a unit the team felt it appopriate to develop this code using a language that we are
familiar with. This will allow us the flexibility to help one another should any of us get
stuck. It also allows the space to look for additional recources since the code is widely
popular and well known.

# Source Control:

GitHub was chosen as it is a free platform and the team all had a little experience using it.

# Meeting Times/ Schedule:

Friday Evenings; 5:30-6:00 PM,

Saturdays as needed

The majority of the team is available to have scrum meetings via Teams Video Call. We will  
 start meeting this way and if it becomes needed as the project progresses, we are able to  
 accommodate meeting at UVU Fulton Library, Daniel's house (As long as there are 6 chairs  
 present), or we can road trip to Enoch's parents' home.

# Project Planner/ Management:

We are using Planner which is offered to facilty and students for free as part of the 365
subscription for UVU. The platform offers the ability to assign tasks and also see who is
marking/ making contributions.

# Scrum Rotations:

We will rotate alphabetically through teammembers for 2 week period durations. The last
couple weeks left over will either be on a volunteer basis or we will default to allowing
Chwazee to assign scrum master for us.

Will rotate alphabetically starting with Anthony, Daniel, Enoch, Amy.

# Meeting Report Summaries:

Friday 1/26/2024 -
Agenda: Ensure every member has access to GitHub and is able to edit the repository.

Issues: We were not added as collaborators and therefore had to formally ask for push and pull requests.

Fix: We ensured Dan added every member as a collaborator so that we could push or commit changes without Dan's constant aproval.

Seperate Topics: Discused how everyones environments were set up. dan suggested Visual Studio Community. GitHub Desktop was also suggested.

Friday 2/9/2024 -
Agenda: Discuss as a group whether we would like to switch projects.

Issues: We are finding the UV Chat assignment to be difficult to conceptualize and vague in instruction. The UVSim seems like it may be a better option for all of us.

Fix: Reach out to professor for requirements on UVSim. Also ponder individually whether making the switch would be personally beneficial as well as beneficial for the group.
Summary of Conversation: The ChatBox although it seems like a fun project feels overwhelming because of the requirement to incorperate API function. There is also the element of having to sync student credentials which are safeguarded by University. Multiples of the group members feel that it would be beneficial to switch so we would be able to work on it independantly from the teacher as well.

Friday 2/16/24
Agenda: Prepare for milestone 3

Issues: We had some confusion on where the project was heading and what was to come next.

Fix: Confirmed some objectives for the following week; what we are each working on. Discussed the GUI library and how it may look in the future.

Separate Topics: We divided the assignment due on Monday 2/19. We will combine our efforts for a wireframe diagram. A release version will be created.

Summary of Conversation: At first, the project's plan needed to be cleared up about what we are working towards and what is due next. We discussed some GUI options
and finished with understanding our assignment due on Monday.
